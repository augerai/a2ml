# Experiment settings that are unique to Auger

  # Latest experiment name

  # Latest experiment session

  # Time series feature. If Data Source contains more then one DATETIME feature
  # you will have to explicitly specify feature to use as time series
  time_series:
  # List of columns which should be used as label encoded features
  label_encoded: []

  # Optional. Default: False. 
  # Estimate Trial Time Predict the training time of each individual model to avoid timeouts.
  #estimate_trial_time: False

  # Optional. Default: None. Use it if you have a lot of failed trials
  # Set it to value < 8 to give trial fit process more memory.  
  # trials_per_worker: 2

  # Optional. Default: None. Used in case of unbalanced datasets.
  # Class Weight Weights associated with classes. If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. 
  # The Balanced mode automatically adjusts weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data. 
  # The Balanced Subsample mode is the same as Balanced except that weights are computed based on the bootstrap sample for every tree grown.
  # class_weight: balanced

  # Oversampling Methods to adjust the class distribution of a data set 
  # (in binary classification if 1-class is 99% and 0-class is 1% then samples from 0-class should be added to dataset in order to prevent overfitting on majority class)
  # Name should be from imbalanced-learn library. For example: SMOTE, RandomOverSampler, ADASYN, SMOTEENN, SMOTETomek
